My solutions for the problems published on projecteuler.net.

Most of them use brute force since I still have to crunch through the math.

Expect the prime number problems to take up to 30 minutes (I implemented the sieve of Eratosthenes).

Of course you can fork this - but make sure to commit your solutions to Project Euler, too!
